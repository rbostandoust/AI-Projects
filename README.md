# AI-Projects
1. CA1: Implementing DFS, BFS, Iterative Deepening Search (IDS) for sloving a maze
2. CA2: Scheduling the university curriculum by genetic algorithm
3. CA3: Implementing forward and backward propagation of neural networks with droupout, L2-Norm to classify not-MNIST dataset. Both gradient-descent and stochastic gradient-descent were studied in this project.
4. CA4:
     1. Regression: Linear, Univariate, Multivariate, Logistic, SVM
     2. Q-Learning
     3. Clustering: K-means, Fuzzy C-means
